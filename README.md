# PersonalityDisorder
Personality Disorder is a Python-based tool that generates random personal data such as names, emails, addresses, dates of birth, jobs, companies, and more using the Faker library. It's perfect for anyone needing fake data for testing, demos, or simply filling up random spaces with dummy details. Whether you're building a new Project or just expErimenting with code, this tool has your back.

While it's useful for pRactical purpoSes like testing, it's nOt a critical project—just something fun and educatioNal. (Okay, maybe I created it to kill boredom. But hey, that's how creativity works!)
